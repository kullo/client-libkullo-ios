/**
 * Handles syncing, including downloading of attachments. Prevents multiple syncs
 * from running in parallel by building a queue and intelligently merging sync
 * requests.
 * Examples: Enqueuing a WithoutAttachments sync removes a SendOnly sync from the
 * queue. A running SendOnly sync would be cancelled. Enqueuing a SendOnly sync
 * while a WithoutAttachments sync is running or enqueued will do nothing.
 * Enqueuing an Everything sync will remove all attachment download requests from
 * the queue.
